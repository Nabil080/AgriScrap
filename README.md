# AgriScrap

**AgriScrap** is a Node.js web scraper using Puppeteer that logs into [agriestdistribution.fr](https://agriestdistribution.fr), scrapes product data from a starting URL (including name, reference, price, and technical specifications), and exports it to an Excel file.

## Features

- Logs into your Agriest account with provided credentials
- Extracts product name, reference, price, and technical properties
- Automatically follows pagination to scrape all linked products
- Exports all data into an `.xlsx` file using `ExcelJS`

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- An Agriest account with valid credentials

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install puppeteer exceljs
````

## Usage

Run the script with the following parameters:

```bash
node agriscrap.js <email> <password> <base_url> <excel_filename>
```

### Example:

```bash
node agriscrap.js mon.email@mail.com mdp1234 https://agriestdistribution.fr/Bennes-a-grappins--0000792-vente/BENNE-A-GRAPPIN-AP-BG-AVC-DTS-LG-1500-QUICKE-3--0002510.html produits_grappins
```

This will:

* Log into your account
* Start scraping the product page and any paginated related products
* Save the results in `results/produits_grappins.xlsx`

## Output

The Excel file contains:

* Product name
* Reference
* Price (brut)
* A list of key-value technical properties

## Notes

* The script uses **brut pricing** by default.
* Ensure the target URL is a **product detail page** that may contain multiple variants.
* Output files are saved in the `results/` folder (create it if it doesnâ€™t exist).
